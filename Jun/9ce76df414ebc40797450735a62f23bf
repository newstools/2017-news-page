The Sandton Central Management District (SCMD) says it is working with Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) to improve traffic signals and traffic flow in the financial hub.According to the Johannesburg Road Agency (JRA), on average roughly 50 of Johannesburg s 2,135 intersections experience signal downtime each day.Aging signal infrastructure and lack of secure electricity supply account for roughly 25% of faults reported daily.Sandton Central said it has has sponsored six uninterrupted power supply (UPS) units for traffic signals at key intersections in the precinct.JRA engineers have also re-timed several intersections to start peak-hour flow timings half-an-hour earlier in the morning, running from 06h00 to 09h00 .Their peak afternoon plans now run longer too, from 15h30 to 20h00 .The intersections are: We have invested in measures to ensure that key traffic signals in the district are always on. Also, we have partnered with the JRA on a number of key initiatives, including a traffic signal forum where we actively engage with both the JRA and Eskom technicians in order to reduce the time traffic signals are down, said Elaine Jack, city improvement district manager for SCMD.The City of Johannesburg also recently announced that it will be allocating an additional R200 million over the next three years to improve traffic management, paying special focus to traffic lights, and the replacement of copper cabling at key intersections.The city has started a no-join policy for fixing electrical faults, ending a practice where signals were fixed by joining cables. In addition, the JRA will be implementing improved traffic monitoring systems, including a 24-hour response centre for responding to reports of signal loss.Looking ahead, SCMD said it would like to see all CID traffic signals resynchronised but, the imminent arrival of Rea Vaya Bust Rapid Transit System in Sandton Central will require the timings to be changed again, which according to the JRA could prove a costly exercise. There has already been a great improvement. We are experiencing less traffic signal outages within Sandton Central as all our traffic signals have been recabled and upgraded. Going forward we hope to engage with the JRA in order to open more road accesses into Sandton Central, which is currently restricted to the only five core entries and exits, said Jack.
