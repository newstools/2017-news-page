Durban Metro Police&#8217;s Equestrian Unit is in shambles with horses being left without food, hay and shavings as a result of on-going procurement issues.Last week, the horses were starved for three days and members of the unit had to fork out money from their own pockets to buy food as they could not stand to see the animals being neglected.To date, there is still a problem with the supply of shavings for the animals, which is apparently an on-going problem just like the food supply. There are currently 14 horses at the unit. The horses rely on the shavings to provide a clean, healthy stall, free of odour.The unit needed at least eight bags of hay and two bags of food to sustain the horses for a day, which costs about R1500.However, these necessities were not being delivered because of a supply chain management issue. This week, the food issue had been resolved but shavings were still not being delivered.Contacted for comment on Wednesday, Steve Middleton, the deputy head of operations at the Metro Police, said he was not aware of the issues with the unit, however, it was highly possible.please make donations belowhttps://candystick.co.za/c/feed-durban-s-police-horses/ Operations rely on logistic support and when there is shortcomings it effects the whole service delivery, said Middleton.Durban and Coast SPCA spokeswoman Lindsey Concer said according to their last monthly check-up, which was conducted in May, the Metro horse stables were up to standard but when the Sunday Tribune visited the stables this week, this was not the case. Horses were still left without shavings.http://www.iol.co.za/sunday-tribune/news/no-food-for-durbans-police-horses-9627065
