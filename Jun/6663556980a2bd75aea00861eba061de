On 6 December 2016 last year Sandra Nolan handed her car to a valet service at OR Tambo to store while she was overseas. Almost a month later, when she returned, she discovered it was in a state. Consumers must be warned about using these services,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I ve been lucky in the past, having used them more than a dozen times with great success. In December, I thought I d try someone new. I searched on Google, saw quite a few listings for valets at OR Tambo, and selected Airport at Best Care Parking. They promised a stress-free experience and awesome service . The owner, Tshidiso Moqhoishe collected the vehicle and off Nolan went, confident in the service because it operated off airport grounds. Or so she thought. Without any disclosure from the company, I discovered that, in my absence, the car had been driven 1935km, there was a chip in the windshield, the front bumper had been fixed and there was a hole in the undercarriage. I noticed these transgressions as soon as I returned home from the airport, and spent the next three weeks emailing quotes for reimbursement and calling Mr Junaid Tshidiso Moqhoishe, who is the owner of the company. He insisted that an employee used my car, yet Moqhoishe s name detail was saved in my car s Bluetooth device. While Nolan was away, somebody seems to have had quite a party in her car over the festive season, not only damaging it but causing a serious dent in her 30,000km maintenance plan, effectively robbing her of more than a month s worth of driving cover. read more belowhttp://www.iol.co.za/motoring/industry-news/valet-parking-service-puts-2000km-on-customers-car-9552515?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social
