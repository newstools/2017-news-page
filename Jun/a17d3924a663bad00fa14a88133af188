Marondera Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, 93, has threatened to embark on fresh land grabs targeting the few white commercial farmers still remaining in the country. We told (former British premier) Tony Blair to keep his England and we keep our Zimbabwe because land is our heritage. We have discovered that in Mashonaland East province alone where Ray Kaukonde was the resident minister, there are 73 white commercial farmers who are still occupying some farms when our people do not have land, said Mugabe speaking in the local Shona language. We are going to take those farms and re-distribute them to our youths, some of whom did not benefit from the land reform programme but the land would not be enough for everybody. We are also going to take away the land from small scale purchase farmers who are not utilising those farms for re-distribution.The combative Mugabe also warned top officials in his administration that they would lose some of the farms parceled out to them during the government-sponsored land reforms.Thousands of white commercial farmers and their employees were displaced and left without sources of income during the fast-tracked agrarian reforms that that were masterminded by Mugabe&#8217;s administration in 2000.FULL ARTICLE BELOWhttp://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/exclusive-mugabe-to-kick-out-all-remaining-white-farmers-says-zimbabweans-need-land-20170604
