Zimbabwe has exploded today with violent protests, angry riots and civil unrest, especially in Harare.The dictator Mugabe has money for water cannon riot trucks costing millions while his people are starving because of his corrupt dictatorship. He is literally holding his own people hostage with incorrect use of police and military this despite the fact that Zimbabwe has become the poorest nation on earth under his rule.By looking at the uniform and the condition of some of the police vehicles, it is obvious that traditional law enforcement and military regimental discipline that respect is lacking. That the Zimbabwean police andmilitary has become nothing more than a band of brainwashed thugs who have been bought by Mugabe.In 2013, the Zimbabwe government had $217 USD in their bank account. Would be interesting to know how much they have now in 2016.This is not Freedom this is far worse oppression &amp; poverty than under the Rhodesian government.With media blackout and repeated violation of constitutional law in South Africa by the current ANC government, this is exactly what South Africa will look like in a few years A ruined country which is bankrupt, starving and desperate with no freedom or rights.Is all the arguing, hate and violent crime worth this freedom 1000 s have died under Mugabes reign of terror.
