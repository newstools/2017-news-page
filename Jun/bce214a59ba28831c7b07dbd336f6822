Forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan has stated that Vodacom owes him R2 million, following a court battle to have his personal information returned.As reported by the Daily Maverick, O Sullivan has filed an application in the Johannesburg High Court against Vodacom.He said he spent R2 million on legal fees after Vodacom gave his personal information to a firm of attorneys representing convicted underworld boss Radovan Krejcir in 2014.The report stated that O Sullivan was investigating Krejcir at the time, and O Sullivan was forced to launch an interdict to have his records handed back. The court ordered Krejcir to pay costs in that matter, but he has since been declared insolvent, stated the report.O Sullivan, who took out a Vodacom contract in 2005, said Vodacom must pay for the costs he incurred to have his information returned. Vodacom are not above the law, O Sullivan told the Daily Maverick. If they think they can hand my cellular records over to the mafia and get away with it, they have a big shock coming to them. O Sullivan stated that Vodacom not only violated the terms of his contract by handing his personal details to the attorneys, but the network did not ask for his permission.The legal fees incurred totaled R2,145,852, along with R151,649 for an application to sequestrate Krejcir s estate.Vodacom spokesperson Byron Kennedy said Vodacom can confirm it has received a summons relating to the legal costs. Vodacom released certain information under a lawfully-issued subpoena as it was obliged to do so in terms of Section 179 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Vodacom will be defending the matter, said Kennedy
