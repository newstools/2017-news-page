Two ladies of the night in Pretoria not only took their client for the proverbial ride, they literally drove off into the sunset with all his personal belongings and his girlfriend s Toyota Yaris worth R180 000.Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said a 28-year-old man allegedly picked the ladies up on Friday night at about 4pm on the corner of Hamilton and Stanza Bopape in Pretoria. He reportedly parked at a food outlet nearby where he consumed alcohol, in the company of his unknown new friend. From that point the man passed out and woke up later that same day in an unknown location in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, Mavimbela said.According to the police, it emerged that the victim had had his VW Polo stolen in 2015 under similar circumstances. In this case he had also picked up two sex workers in Pretoria Central.
