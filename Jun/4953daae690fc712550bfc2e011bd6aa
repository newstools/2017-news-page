Poet Ntsiki Mazwai has again taken to social media to criticise South Africa s education system that seems to take away the Africaness of a black child.During a diatribe against the global dominance of white culture , she went as far as to suggest that white people have exerted a very violent effect on South Africa, with the entire ethnic group known in South Africa as coloureds being one of the results.In a series of tweets, Mazwai said it was embarrassing when grown black men speak broken English to try to impress when they can just speak their own languages.Though one of her weaknesses was her inability to be fluent in her mother tongue, she was proud of herself because even the best white schools in the country had not won in trying to make her worship whiteness . I think education took the best part of me ..my Africaness [sic]. The main problem with the education system was its failure to teach the black child about their history and heroes, according to the poet. Teach the black child about her own heroes .because white heroes don t mean shit to us even white celebrities mean dololo to u. Your white heroes are not my heroes .I have my own heroes, she said.full article belowColoureds &#8216;come from white men raping black women&#8217;
