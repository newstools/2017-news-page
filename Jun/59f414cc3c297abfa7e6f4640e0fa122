There has been a huge outcry as Audi SA failed to meet its client halfway by issuing a major call back for its audi a4, a5, TT Quatro and Q5 series vehicles.This comes after Audi America lost a multi-million dollar lawsuit for the same problem South-african&#8217;s now face. These audi&#8217;s reportedly uses a scary amount of oil due to a bad batch of pistons and oil rings, Audi Usa and Audi uk have issued nationwide recalls to rectify these problems at no cost to its clients, but Audi SA refuses to rectify these problems claiming its normal for the tfsi motors to use excessive oil.Some audi owners owners claim they use over a liter on a 1000 km.in a number of widely sold models that require frequently topping off the oil reservoir between recommended oil changes. That s a worry and cost that a new-car owner shouldn t have.It s normal for cars to burn a little oil as they age toward 100,000 miles and beyond. But Consumer Reports believes that for an almost new car to burn that excessive amount of oil is unacceptable.The case highlights the difference between how American consumers can seek redress from car makers compared with those in South-Africa. Thanks to American laws, the class action did not just benefit Der Sarkissian and his fellow claimants. It also opened the floodgates for every other US Audi owner with the same, problematic, 2-litre petrol engine built between 2008 and 2011. Each one was identified by Audi and contacted.Unless they took a decision to opt out and try to pursue their own legal action, they too were entitled to have their car fixed free of charge by the company, or if they had already paid for the repair themselves a refund.We await a response from Audi SA
