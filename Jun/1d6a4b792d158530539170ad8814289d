In a landmark judgment delivered on Thursday, the Constitutional Court said that judges have an obligation to ensure that evictions will not leave people homeless. The Concourt delivered the judgment after hearing a case where residents in an apartment block had agreed to be evicted without knowing their rights.There were 184 residents who faced eviction from a block of flats called Kiribilly in Berea near inner city Johannesburg. Some of the residents have occupied the building for more than 26 years. In 2013, they were served with a notice that they would be evicted.When the matter was heard in the Johannesburg high court later that year for a court order to be granted, a member of the Johannesburg ward committee agreed to the eviction on behalf of the residents. He had not received a mandate to do so from the residents themselves. But the court granted the eviction order, saying the parties had come to an agreement.https://mg.co.za/article/2017-06-09-judges-can-no-longer-lawfully-order-evictions-that-leave-people-homeless
