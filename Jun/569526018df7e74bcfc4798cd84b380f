Farm Attack &#8211; Sannieshof, Northwest widow dragged by her hair and hit in the faceBlackie van den Berg&#8217;s neighbor heard the whole attack on the phone because Van den Berg called the neighbors when she heard the robbers outside the house. &#8220;Blackie said,&#8221; Here they come, you have to come. They speak Afrikaans, &#8220;said the neighbor, Coreen van den Berg, on Friday morning.&#8220;She told the robber who was in her room that he could take anything but he said he was looking for her. He had a spit fork with him. &#8221; There were two robbers and they fled when Coreen&#8217;s husband, Bertus, arrived at the farm about ten minutes after Van den Berg called them.&#8220;She is now in Wilmedpark Hospital (in Klerksdorp).&#8221; According to Coreen, a cousin of Van den Berg, she phoned them at about 01:00 on Friday morning, saying she heard noises outside the house, but at first she thought it might be cats on the roof. &#8220;As we talk to her, we heard a bang noise. Bertus said it was definitely not cats, jumped in his car and drove to Coreen. &#8221;the case is being investigated
