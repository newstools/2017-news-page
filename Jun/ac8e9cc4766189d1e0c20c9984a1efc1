This is the shocking moment a nanny slaps a toddler across the face after the child had been left in her care.Parents named only as SE and MTE hired nanny Nadia Shapoval, 54, to look after their son, but became concerned when they spotted bruises on his body.The parents hid cameras in their Istanbul home six months ago, and watched back footage showing Shapoval stuffing the child into his high chair before slapping him across the face.Before the family saw the footage, they had fired MTE, over issues with her behaviour.When they saw she had also assaulted their child, the parents filed a police complaint against her, though they did not know where she was.SE tracked her down to Marmaris, in south-western Turkey, driving nearly 450 miles where he found her waking the streets alone.Shapoval is said to have broken down into tears before being taken to Sehit Nedip Eker Police Station, where she refused to talk to officers.Police did not report what she had been charged with but said she would come before a court in due course.She is not thought to have been remanded in custody.
