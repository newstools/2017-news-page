A facebook user Suraksha Sookdeo had a horrific incident this past week, she and her husband were involved in a motor vehicle accident with a tow truck driver, members of durban metro police arrived on the scene and according to her tampered with the scene, threatened her husband and then allowing the tow truck driver to leave the scene.below is her story posted on PPAC.&#8220;Can anyone please help me locating these chatsworth metro police reason being we were involved in an accident on the m7 with the breakdowns as seen in the pic. The metro police instead of assisting us changed the scene without allowing us to get proper details(vehicle and driver details) threatened my husband to lock him although he wasn&#8217;t at fault. When my husband went to assist the driver from van A the driver from van B ran out threatening my husband with a baseball bat and when he asked the police to hold him for questioning they allowed the driver from van B to leave the scene without getting he&#8217;s proper details or any details at all. Is this the way for a police officers to behave????????&#8221;
