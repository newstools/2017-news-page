Please note if you were planning to go south tomorrow from Durban. Avoid Prospecton in the morning. There is a planned march that has been approved and will be monitored by SAPS and Metro police. No panic necessary. Simply avoid the area for the time stipulated. If you have to work in that area, get to the office well before 8am
