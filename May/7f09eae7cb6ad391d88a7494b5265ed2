Ok so this might come as a surprise, but Zimbabwe actually still manages to run its own airline, albeit without much funding and, as the European Commission pointed out, by cutting corners when it comes to safety.On Tuesday the European Commission (EC) officially banned Air Zimbabwe from entering European airspace, as Mugabe s favourite mode of flying doesn t meet international safety standards. All air carriers from Benin and Mozambique were removed from the EU Air Safety List, while four individual airlines, one each from Nigeria, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Ukraine, and Zimbabwe, were added, the EC said in a statement.eNCA reports that back in 1980 when Mugabe liberated Zimbabwe, the country had a fleet of 18 aeroplanes, a number that has dwindled to less than a third of that, with an operating deficit of over $300 million. That s US dollars, not Zim.Now, while Batty bob Mugabe is more than happy to use AirZim when he s headed out he reportedly prefers flying his own airline when travelling abroad shopping for a new liver, kidney or diamond for his wife (dis)Grace; the EC has mad it clear that it will not jeopardise the safety of any European citizen by allowing ZimAir to operate within its airspace.In addition to Air Zimbabwe, the EC has added Nigeria s Med-View airlines, St Vincent and the Grenadine s Mustique Airways and the Ukraine s Urga Aviation to the list of banned airlines; bringing the total number of international carriers barred from operating within one of the most profitable zones on the planet to 181.
