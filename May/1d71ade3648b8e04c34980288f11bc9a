CAPE TOWN It has emerged an eight-year-old boy has not been to school since the start of this year after he was raped, allegedly by a fellow pupil.The crime, which was reported last year, allegedly happened near the child s Ottery home.It s believed the child was teased by other pupils who knew that he d been raped and is too afraid to return to the classroom.At the start of this year, his mother applied for enrollment at another school but says she is yet to receive a response from the Western Cape Education Department.The department s Millicent Merton says the situation is regrettable. The mother applied for a school at the end of January. And a school that could accommodate the learner was identified but district officials were unable to reach the parent. It is regrettable that that information was relayed to her so that she could be put into contact with the correct people to speak to. There were three victims; the perpetrator got hold of three children aged seven, eight and nine. The very day it happened, they were alerted (along) with the police. The parents all went to Grassy Park Police station and from there they went to Victoria Hospital where they all received victim support. Source: EWN
