South Africans will be the first in the world to use biometric credit cards.Mastercard will introduce the technology by the end of the year allowing consumers to pay with a combination of a chip in the card and a fingerprint. Authenticating a payment transaction biometrically in this instance via a fingerprint confirms in a very unique way that the person using the card is the genuine cardholder Mastercard said on Thursday.The full-scale South African rollout follows two recent trials with employees at Pick n Pay and Absa.Consumers fingerprints will be stored on the credit card. When it s time to pay cardholders will dip the card into a retailer s terminal while placing their finger on the embedded sensor.The fingerprint will then be verified and if the biometrics match the transaction will be approved without the card leaving the consumer s hand.Said Mastercard: For issuers the technology helps detect and prevent fraud increase approval rates reduce operational costs and foster customer loyalty. Additionally a future version of the card will feature contactless technology adding to the simplicity and convenience at checkout. Source : TimesLive
