The current wave of abuse, including murder, against women and children has a direct link to the apartheid system, which was fundamentally violent, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said yesterday. This violence has a long history. Our country was taken by force and it was ruled by force for more than 350 years. Violence is part of the South African DNA and this need to be combated. Meanwhile, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, alongside the SAPS, has been urged to take up children&#8217;s issues seriously ahead of National Child Protection Week, which runs from May 26 to June 2.Shocking findings by child protection activists yesterday revealed that while child abandonment cases have slightly declined, a new trend known as anonymous abandonments is on the rise with little chance of children being reunited with their biological families.http://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/mthethwa-blames-crime-on-apartheid-9308674
