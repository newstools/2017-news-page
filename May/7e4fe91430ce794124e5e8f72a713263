Erin Hatzi is sharing the crazy story about how her stolen car was returned. Hatzi woke up one morning to find her red car missing. She immediately checked her security cameras, which showed a woman getting into the vehicle and driving away. We were really confused because it didn t seem like the normal actions of a car thief she told reporters. You wouldn t think they d sit there in idle in the owner s driveway for two or three minutes. Hatzi said she filed a police report and waited for answers. The next morning, her husband was taking out the trash when he saw a police officer had a woman stopped right outside of their home. The woman had just gotten out of the red car and had left some cash and a note inside the car.Hatzi posted the stranger s note on Facebook, which described the crazy way the car was stolen in the first place. Hello, So sorry I stole your car. I sent my friend with my key to pick up my red car and she came back with your car. I did not see the car until this morning and I said, that is not my car. There is some cash and I more than apologize for the shock and upset this must have caused you. If you need to speak further, with me, I am ******* and my number is . So so sorry for this mistake. Police reportedly confirmed to Hatzi that certain older model car keys sometimes work in different cars.It turns out, the right car was a block away the whole time. It s insane, Hatzi said. It s like a bad sitcom that nobody would ever buy the story because it s stupid and it makes no sense. But it happened.
