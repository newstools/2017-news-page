Durban- prostitutes in Durban are now trying new tricks to get into vehicles driven by men. They are now forcing themselves into vehicles, even going to extent to staging the fact that they&#8217;re in trouble and asking passers by for help.Once gaining access into vehicles they harass the driver demanding money. They threaten that if the driver doesn&#8217;t pay they will make a scene that the driver used their &#8220;services&#8221; and did not pay or they try to seduce the driver into using their &#8220;services&#8221;.This places the driver into a very difficult position while they refuse to get out of the vehicle until they are given money.Drivers please be vigilant to these women. They can ruin the reputation of an innocent person
