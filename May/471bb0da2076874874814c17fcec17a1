Incidentally, both Limpopo and the Eastern Cape consistently underperform in terms of service delivery to residents.The Western Cape spent the smallest chunk of its budget, 53.1%, on salaries. In total, R311.4 billion was spent by all nine provinces on salaries in the 2016/17 financial year.Now, while a large chunk of provincial budgets goes to paying salaries of teachers and the like, it s interesting to see how much of each department s budget actually goes to servicing said department.Example: Limpopo spent the highest amount of its budget on healthcare, but only 2.2% of that went to actual capital expenditure in healthcare, the bulk went to paying healthcare workers salaries.While paying salaries is important, so too should be the actual spending on delivering the services employees are paid to deliver not so?
