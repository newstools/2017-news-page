Nompumelelo communicated the whole week and pretended to be so concerned and even promised to drive down to sort the lease issue, until i phoned the other time and the phone was answered by someone who just said she was a Chisa nyama and from then on, she went quiet as well.her phone is off up to now , and she got away with my money just like that.
