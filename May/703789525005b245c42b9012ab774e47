Over a year after the death of a Croftdene teenager, who was treated as a possible overdose case when rushed to the trauma unit at RK Khan Hospital, his post mortem results were released, revealing the devastating yet comforting news his family never expected.The family of 18-year-old Lucalis Pillay wept as the detective read out the post mortem reports which indicated that he died of cancer, RisingsunChatsworth, reported.Shortly after matriculating from Witteklip Secondary School, Pillay was rushed to the hospital for continuous vomiting and lack of feeling in his legs.Speaking with a heavy heart, his elder brother, Luvalan, said that when his brother arrived at the hospital, he was drained of all fluids from his body and diagnosed as a possible overdose case and even though they told staff and doctors that he never took an overdose, he was still treated as an overdose case and subsequently passed away the day after admission. The doctor is always right and we need to listen to them, we thought. We pushed him in his stretcher to his ward where he begged the nurses to bring him only vegetables as he was observing the fast for Kavady.The next day, he visited the psychologist in his dazed state and he claimed that he had never taken any form of medication that could lead to an overdose. The next day when we visited him, he began convulsing. When we approached the nurses, who rushed to come see to him, they thereafter told us that we shouldn t worry because Lucalis was faking the fit due to his family being present, he recalled.According to Luvalan, Lucalis slipped into a coma shortly thereafter and passed away later that night.While doctors continued to reaffirm that the cause of Lucalis death was an overdose, which could have possibly been by ingesting brake fluid as well, his family hung onto the thought that Lucalis passed away due to medical conditions.After the post mortem results revealed that Lucalis was diagnosed with Choriocarcinoma Metastasis, Luvalan, a teacher at a local primary school, launched an organisation called the Bokem Legacy, which intends on keeping his brother s legacy alive by helping those who are diagnosed with cancer.With the intent of raising R20, 000 for the Chatsworth Hospice, the Bokem Legacy will host a family fun day on May 27 at Astra Primary School grounds (41 Dunveria Crescent). The event will also include friendly games of soccer and volleyball and a candle lighting ceremony in memory of those who had lost loved ones to cancer.For more information on the event, contact Luvalan on 081-729-73339. Attempts to obtain a comment from RK Khan Hospital proved futile at the time of going to print. Source: RisingSunChatsworthhttp://tellitallsa.co.za/rk-khans-alleged-misdiagnosis-leads-boys-death/
